Dabbling in Go.

## SoftUni
This reporsitory contains my solutions to some of the tasks from a course I'm taking in SoftUni. The course is "[Programming Basics with Go - февруари 2022](https://softuni.bg/trainings/3683/programming-basics-with-go-february-2022#lesson-38821)".

## Environment
I don't like installing programming languages and packages globally (I end up with 3 web servers fighting each other) on my computer, so I use Docker. To get that going : 
1.  docker-compose up
2.  docker-compose ps - check if the container is up
3.  docker-compose run go
4.  go run yardGreening.go - run files
